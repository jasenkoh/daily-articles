# daily-articles


My first app built on top of <a href="https://meteor.com" target="_blank">MeteorJS</a>. Idea is to integrate various providers and feed users with articles based on selected category.

Currently only reddit is integrated, user can add subreddits and get articles manually by clicking "Feed me from Reddit!" or visit site from time to time and see if there are new articles (every 4 hours new posts with 6 or more upvotes are fetched). "Feed me from System" is showing only articles that are in app db.

Have any ideas or feedback, feel free to reach me at <a href="mailto:contact@jasenko.me">contact@jasenko.me</a>.
